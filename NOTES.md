decls vdecl { ($2 :: fst $1), snd $1 }

here let 
int x;

program consists of global variable delarations and function declarations. They both are of type decls. Just like in calc (1 + 2) was of type expr and 1, 2 were themselves of type expr. So we need to further check what kind of decl it is.


$1 = (type,int)
$2 = (ID,x)
$3 = SEMI = ;

hence the above line means that 

(x,type) = int (maybe wrong, but we think here its being stored in the symbol table)
