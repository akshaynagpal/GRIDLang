Flashing Yellow "X": This lane can only be used for a left turn.
Lines that separate lanes of traffic that moves in the same direction are white.
Lines that separate traffic that moves in opposite directions are yellow.

One solid line: You can pass other vehicles or change lanes, but you can only do so when obstructions in the road or traffic conditions make it necessary.
